Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for developing a School Management and Student Assessment System software. The SDLC is a systematic process used by software developers to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. Here is a suggested SDLC along with a brief description of each phase:

Planning:

In this phase, gather requirements from stakeholders, identify project scope, and define the overall objectives of the School Management and Student Assessment System. Create a project plan, allocate resources, and set timelines.

##Feasibility Study:

Assess the technical, economic, legal, operational, and scheduling feasibility of the project. This phase helps in determining whether the project is viable and worth proceeding.

#System Design:

Create a detailed system design based on the gathered requirements. Design the architecture, database structure, user interface, and modules. This phase also involves creating prototypes or wireframes to visualize the system.

#Implementation (Coding):

Write the code based on the design specifications. Developers should follow coding standards and best practices. Unit testing should be performed to ensure that individual components work as intended.

#Testing:

Conduct various types of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Identify and fix bugs, ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of major defects.

#Deployment:

Deploy the School Management and Student Assessment System to the production environment. Ensure that all necessary components are installed, and configurations are correct. Plan for user training and data migration if needed.

#Maintenance and Support:

Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the software. Address any issues that arise, implement updates or enhancements, and ensure the system continues to meet the needs of users.

#Documentation:

Throughout the SDLC, maintain comprehensive documentation, including requirements specifications, design documents, user manuals, and technical documentation. This is crucial for future reference and maintenance.

#User Training:

Conduct training sessions for end-users to familiarize them with the School Management and Student Assessment System. Provide user manuals and support during the initial stages of system use.

#Feedback and Iteration:

Gather feedback from users and stakeholders after the system is in use. Use this feedback to make improvements and enhancements to the system in subsequent iterations.
By following this SDLC, we can systematically develop a School Management and Student Assessment System software that meets the needs of educational institutions and facilitates efficient management and assessment processes.

In this Model, you can start with some of the software specifications and develop the first version of the software. After the first version if there is a need to change the software, then a new version of the software is created with a new iteration. Every release of the Iterative Model finishes in an exact and fixed period that is called iteration.

The Iterative Model allows the accessing earlier phases, in which the variations made respectively. The final output of the project renewed at the end of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process.

Here's how the Iterative Model would apply to the development of the School Management and Student Assessment System:

#1. Requirement gathering & analysis: In this phase, requirements are gathered from customers and check by an analyst whether requirements will fulfil or not. Analyst checks that need will achieve within budget or not. After all of this, the software team skips to the next phase.

#2. Design: In the design phase, team design the software by the different diagrams like Data Flow diagram, activity diagram, class diagram, state transition diagram, etc.
   
#3. Implementation: In the implementation, requirements are written in the coding language and transformed into computer programmes which are called Software.

#4. Testing: After completing the coding phase, software testing starts using different test methods. There are many test methods, but the most common are white box, black box, and grey box test methods.

#5. Deployment: After completing all the phases, software is deployed to its work environment.

#6. Review: In this phase, after the product deployment, review phase is performed to check the behaviour and validity of the developed product. And if there are any error found then the process starts again from the requirement gathering.

#7. Maintenance: In the maintenance phase, after deployment of the software in the working environment there may be some bugs, some errors or new updates are required. Maintenance involves debugging and new addition options.
